### There are nine steps on this competition:
(((For each numbered step take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.)))  

## 1) Setup - Delete any existing forks of the repository from your account.  
If you have a fork already, go to its settings in github and scroll all the way down to delete it:

If you didn't have a fork, or you just deleted the old one, go to the [original repository ](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) to fork it (details below).  

## 2) Setup - Fork the repository.   
Once you clicked [that link](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7), click the `Fork` button in the upper right hand corner.

The last step to create the fork is to give it a name (there's one by default already) and an optional description.

Click the `Create Fork` button.

## 3) The real deal - Start the timer!

## 4) Log into ieng6.   
- Open Visual Studio Code's terminal using `Ctrl + back-quote`. 
- Type `ssh` `cs15lwi23[your unique letters here]@ieng6.ucsd.edu` 
- Type your password.
> Note that if you want to avoid all of this, you can refer to the class website to [set up ssh keys for ieng6 and github](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week7/#:~:text=Command%2DLine%20Setup-,Generating%20SSH%20Keys%20for%20ieng6,-With%20the%20setup).  

## 5) Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account.   
Because you will work with the fork you just made, on its main page, click on `code` to copy the `ssh` link to clone.

On the terminal, already connected to the server, type `git clone` and paste the ssh link. Hit `Enter`.

> I always `ls` to know what changed, where I'm at, and to display the names of what I will be working on. It's a good habit.  

## 6) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail.   
cd into lab7 like this: `cd lab7` so we can compile its java files and run junit. (Remember to `ls`)

If you go to [week 3](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week3/#:~:text=you%20run%20them%3A-,MAC%20USERS%3A,-local%20%24%20javac%20%2Dcp), you can find the code needed to compile all java files and run Junit.  
The code is the following: 
To compile I typed `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java`
To run Junit I typed `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore` + the name of the junit file (in this case, is `ListExamplesTests`.

> Notice how you don't write `.java` when you run the tester.  








## 7) Edit the code file to fix the failing test  

## 8) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed  

## 9) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)  



For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. 
Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
