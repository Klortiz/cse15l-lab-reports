### There are nine steps on this competition:
(((For each numbered step take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.)))  

## 1) Setup - Delete any existing forks of the repository from your account.  
If you have a fork already, go to its settings in github and scroll all the way down to delete it:

If you didn't have a fork, or you just deleted the old one, go to the [original repository ](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) 




## 2) Setup - Fork the repository  
## 3) The real deal Start the timer!  
## 4) Log into ieng6  
## 5) Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account  
## 6) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail  
## 7) Edit the code file to fix the failing test  
## 8) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed  
## 9) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)  



For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. 
Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
