### There are nine steps on this competition:
(((For each numbered step take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.)))  

## 1) Setup - Delete any existing forks of the repository from your account.  
If you have a fork already, go to its settings in github and scroll all the way down to delete it:

If you didn't have a fork, or you just deleted the old one, go to the [original repository ](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) to fork it (details below).  

## 2) Setup - Fork the repository  
Once you clicked [that link](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7), click the `Fork` button in the upper right hand corner.

The last step to create the fork is to give it a name (there's one by default already) and an optional description.

Click the `Create Fork` button.

## 3) The real deal - Start the timer!

## 4) Log into ieng6  
- Open Visual Studio Code's terminal using `Ctrl + back-quote`. 
- Type `ssh` `cs15lwi23[your unique letters here]@ieng6.ucsd.edu` 
- Type your password.
> Note that if you want to avoid all of this, you can refer to the class website to [set up ssh keys for ieng6 and github](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week7/#:~:text=Command%2DLine%20Setup-,Generating%20SSH%20Keys%20for%20ieng6,-With%20the%20setup).  

## 5) Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account  

## 6) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail  

## 7) Edit the code file to fix the failing test  

## 8) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed  

## 9) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)  



For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. 
Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
