Buenas! I'm Kristhian Ortiz, and this is a tutorial about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.
You will have to go through this process every time you take a new class that requires you to access their folders remotely.
Note: Make sure you have your class account ready to rock!

### 1) Installing VS Code and Git.

> Here's where to download [Visual Studio Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
> 
> Here's where to download [Git for Windows.](https://gitforwindows.org/)

After downloading, open both files and follow the prompts so you have the actual applications installed.
Note: You need to login with an account for VS Code, I'd reccommend doing so with your class account.

Next Step will be to migrate Git into VS Code so we can use them together.
(Git is a terminal, so we're basically changing VS Code's terminal so it alligns with the class language).

### 2) Setting up Git in VS Code to access your class computer remotely - using ***ieng6***.

(Technically, we're doing SSH - Secure Shell - which is a secure way to access computers remotely)
> Open VS Code original terminal (so we can override it with git) using ``Ctrl + ` ``
> 
> Type: `ssh [name of account]@***ieng6***.[domain].edu` (For me, it would be cse15lwi23aue@ieng6.ucsd.edu)

### 3) Testing out some commands.
