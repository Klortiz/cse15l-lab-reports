# Lab Report 4 - Kristhian Ortiz


For each numbered step take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step.  

1) Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account.  
If you have a fork already, go to its settings in github and scroll all the way down to delete it:

If you didn't have a fork, or you just deleted the old one, go to the [original repository ](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) 




3) Setup Fork the repository  
4) The real deal Start the timer!  
5) Log into ieng6  
6) Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account  
7) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail  
8) Edit the code file to fix the failing test  
9) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed  
10) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)  



For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. 
Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
